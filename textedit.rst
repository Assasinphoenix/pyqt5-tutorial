TextEdit
========
The TextEdit widget is a powerful text display widget, with the ability to display both plain text and formatted text. It can handle paragraphs, images, tables, and lists, with the rich text display ability powered by HTML markup.

Smaller amounts of text are probably best being displayed using the :doc:`label` widget. Alternatively, if the application only handles plain text content, it is better to use :doc:`plaintextedit`.
