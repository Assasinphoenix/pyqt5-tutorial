ScrollArea
==========
A ScrollArea widget provides a container for another widget to be placed, providing scrolling in both vertical and horizontal directions when the child is larger than the space allocated.

The ScrollArea automatically provides :doc:`scrollbar` objects and is preferred in most cases when scrolling must be provided.
